Tritech StarFish 990F Sidescan Sonar GPS extraction tool
===

This is a Shiny web app.
It is written on [R programming language](http://cran.r-project.org/ "R webpage") using the [Shiny library](http://shiny.rstudio.com/ "Shiny webpage") to develop the General User Interface.
With this tool you can import [Tritech StarFish 990F](http://www.tritech.co.uk/product/starfish-990f-high-resolution-side-scan-sonar-shallow-water0 "Tritech webpage") Sidescan Sonar CSV raw files from [ScanLine software](http://www.tritech.co.uk/support-software/starfish-seabed-imaging-systems-scanline "Scanline software webpage") and extract the navigation as:

- Text datatables (.csv)
- ESRI Shapefiles (.shp)
- KML file format (.kml)

The aim of this software is "fast extract" of the navigation data to visualize it on a GIS software like [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org "QGIS webpage") or in a web map in the "Maps" tab.

You can run a demo [here](https://glopez.shinyapps.io/StarFishNavigation "shinyapps.io"), but I suggest run it locally using R because the csv raw files are generally big files (hundreds of megabytes) to upload over internet.
